# TapBoat_Unity
A game where you have to follow a path

**How it works:**

-Follow the path, tap on the left side of the screen to turn left, right side to turn right

-Jump over the obstacles by holding down

-Charge the jump, don't wait to long! (The red bar is the jump force and the fade is the time remaining to jump)

**More mechanics:**

    -Respawn

    -Score

    -Timer when jumping



**What I learned:**

    -Algorithm to generate paths randomly

    -Algortihm to generate obstacles randomly

    -Algorithm to calculate jump force using sine waves
